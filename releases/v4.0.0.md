# v4.0.0

## Breaking Changes

**Complete data reset required.** There is no backward compatibility from V3 - all existing data will be deleted during migration.

## New SDK Payload Format

- `actions[]` array replaces `current_page` and checkpoint-based syncing
- Attributes always sent with every payload for reliability
- Simplified SDK state management (no more `attributesSent` flag)

## New Events Table Schema

Updated field structure to support the new action-based payload format.

## Migration

When upgrading from V3 to V4:
1. All workspace databases will be dropped
2. All system database tables will be cleared (users, workspaces, etc.)
3. Fresh tables will be created on startup
4. All analytics data will be lost - export before upgrading if needed
