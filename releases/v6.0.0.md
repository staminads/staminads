# v6.0.0

## User ID Dimension

Track authenticated users across sessions with the new `user_id` dimension. This enables:

- Cross-session user journey analysis
- Linking anonymous sessions to authenticated users
- User-level metrics and segmentation

### SDK Usage

```javascript
staminads.setUserId('user-123');
```

Call `setUserId()` when a user logs in. The user ID is stored in localStorage and persists across page reloads and browser sessions until explicitly cleared with `setUserId(null)` or `reset()`.

## Export User Events API

New `export.userEvents` endpoint for exporting user-level event data to external systems:

- CRM platforms
- Customer Data Platforms (CDP)
- Data warehouses
- Marketing automation tools

## Privacy Compliance

Using the `user_id` feature requires explicit user consent to comply with GDPR and ePrivacy regulations. Only set a user ID after obtaining appropriate consent for tracking authenticated user activity.

## Migration

Auto-upgrade: existing databases are automatically migrated on startup.
